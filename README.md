# Project-1 : Heart-Strokes_Predictions
*It is a real time project which predicts the patients heart storkes based on machine learning algorithms.

*I have used Decision Tree and Random forest to check which suits best in predicting.

*Got 90 and 94% accuracy respectively for predictions by classifying patients dataset.

*It is also visualized in lot of aspects to best outcomes and well trained model.


# Project-2 : Real_Estate_Price_Prediction

*It is a living Quaters price predictions for customers who are in need to check the costs of flats for purchase and rents. It would help them in search of flats by bedrooms, bathrooms and square feets of a flat. Mostly, customers look for these basic requirements in search, by making that into account i made this project to make their work efficent.

*It was a trained on different ML algorithms, but LinearRegression was made the best choice to get accuracy of 75% which predicted the best results.


# Project-3 : Birds-Recognization

* It is a CNN model which predicts the different sets of birds and the model trained on only two categories of birds like - OWL and Sparrow.

* The model has trained well and predicting the birds perfectly and also used as a pre-trained model for the other projects.

* Accuracy of 90% in predicting the birds.
